Having published two RubyGems now, I think my projects are pretty cool. Sure, [boardgame_engine](https://github.com/Forthoney/boardgame_engine) and [consolo](https://github.com/Forthoney/consolo) could use some polish, but at their core, they do fill niches that haven't been filled, and I'm pretty satisfied with how they are progressing.

But despite my being proud of them, I haven't quite figured out how to "get the word out" to other people. Same thing with this blog. I don't really know how to advertise my work to the world. 

Thankfully, I do have friends who are pretty successful with advertising their material. In preparation for my next project which will I really want people to know about, I benchmark and analyze what they do for self-promotion.

## Social Media
This is probably the quickest and easiest way. I have some friends who have substack blogs([Duck's](https://duckduckhero.substack.com/), [YS's](https://yoonseok.substack.com/)). Between the two, I particularly took interest and inspiration from Duck's blog.
