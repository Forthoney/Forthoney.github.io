## Name
My name written in Korean (the original way) is 정성헌.
"Seong-Heon" is my first name and "Jung" is my last name.

### Pronunciation
My name is pronounced
- __Seong__ as in sing-sang-(_sung_)
- __Heon__ as in (_hon_)ey
- __Jung__ as in (_seong_) but replace the s with a j
All three sounds in my name actually have the same vowel sound, but my first name uses "eo" to represent this vowel and my last name uses "u".
This is due to complicated but interesting bureaucratic reasons. The short answer is the romanization guidelines changed between when my grandparents decided to romanize their names and when I romanized my name. So, my last name (which I take from my father & paternal grandfather) follows the old standards and my first name follows the [new standard](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Revised_Romanization_of_Korean).

### Hanja
In hanja, my name is 聖憲. It's roughly equivalent to wise/holy law. A fortune teller said it was a good name; go figure.

## (Dis)ability
I suffer from a form of sleep-related disease that I will not go into more detail because internet scary.
I do truly mean it when I write that I _suffer_ from it, but I still try to make the most out of it.
A couple benefits that come with my disease are
- I am a seasoned sleep paralysis victim and can describe some experiments I did while paralyzed.
- I adjust freakishly fast to jetlag.
