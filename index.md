I'm interested in how **Programming Languages** can facilitate writing better parallel programs, where "better" means (a) more performant, (b) less buggy, and (c) easier to reason about. In other words, I seek to improve both high-level abstractions for parallelism and also low-level implementation of parallelism primitives in programming languages.

This site is built with a Jekyll theme I published myself, [consolo](https://github.com/Forthoney/consolo).
