### *WERB: Fully Ruby Frontends with WASM* @ RubyConf 2023 San Diego
##### Nov. 13-15

### *Seeing through a Computer: Reinterpreting Hieroglyphs through ML* @ Brown EGYT 2200
##### Oct. 25, Nov. 1
As a [Data Science Fellow](https://dsi.brown.edu/academics/data-science-fellows), I developed a two-part workshop for a graduate level Egyptology course (Monumentality and Texts in ancient Egypt).
The workshop introduces students to data science and ML through a practical miniproject. The students start from collecting and generating hieroglyphics data all the way to discovering previously unnoticed similarities between hieroglyphics through unsupervised classfication.

### *From Shell Programs to Data Engineering Workflows, Automatically* @ 3rd PaSh Workshop
##### Oct. 18
I presented my ongoing work on PaSh to fellow researchers and guests from Brown, Northwestern, Stevens Institute of Technology, and National Technical University of Athens.
