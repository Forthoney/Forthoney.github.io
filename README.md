# Seong-Heon's Blog
A casual blog about myself I threw together one day just because.

I heavily modded [jekyll-theme-console](https://github.com/b2a3e8/jekyll-theme-console)
which had a phenomenal aesthetic, but lacked very basic features. 
Modifications/improvements include
- Displays website title in header
- Arranges contact info, socials, and description in footer without needing raw html
- Refactoring of CSS for better expandibility
